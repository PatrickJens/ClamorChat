# ClamorChat
Web based chat application deployed on the Heroku cloud. 

When running on localhost, the MySQL connection object must be changed to match the MySQL connection on the local machine.

The Heroku MySQL API times out after 60 seconds, so a dummy query is executed every 55 seconds.

Additionally, the Heroku hosting service times out after 30 minutes of inactivity. Any potential employeers or recruiters must contact me (the author) to activate the application for demo purposes.
